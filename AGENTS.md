# humanize-ai agent guide

Humanize AI Claude plugin: detect AI-writing tells, rewrite, and audit while keeping facts, names, numbers and quotes intact.

**Structure:** `skills/` (`humanize-ai`, `ai-pattern-detector`, `ai-pattern-remover`, `humanize-ai-auditor`), `knowledge/` (patterns by source), `scripts/setup.sh`, `evals/`.

## Commands
- First clone: `bash scripts/setup.sh` (creates the git-ignored personal customizations file); `scripts/update.sh` to update.
- Validate: `claude plugin validate . --strict`
- Evals (real model calls): `claude plugin eval . --trust-plugin --ablation none --scaffold --allow-tools Read Glob Grep Skill -j 4 --no-publish`. Rebuild cases with `python A:\Automation\plugin-evals\regen_evals.py <plugin> <router> <fixture ids>`. Write results outside the repo (`D:\SyncWin\AI Outputs\<plugin>\eval-results`); the packager includes repo files.

## Workflow
1. Read the skill or script you change, plus its neighbours.
2. Make the smallest change; run the closest check, then the full gate.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` for behavior changes; log ideas in `IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

## Rules
- Run the closest check and the full gate before committing. Never delete or weaken tests or evals. Report failed, skipped or timed-out runs honestly; NOT RUN is never a pass.
- Follow neighbouring files. Keep each `SKILL.md` under 500 lines; move detail into `references/`.
- On release, bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and every skill's `metadata.version` together; add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry per behavior change.
- No commits, pushes or PRs unless asked. Work on a branch and open a PR; never push to main.
- No new dependencies without asking (scripts stay on the Python standard library).
- Never commit secrets. Never pick names or slugs without user confirmation.
- Keep em dashes and en dashes out of skills, docs and examples, except where a rule names the characters.
- A fact that changes during a rewrite is a high-priority bug.
- Edit the knowledge file that owns a rule; never restate it in a second file. Update its "Last verified" date when you check a source. Paraphrase sources; cite new ones in `NOTICE.md`.
- Version bumps: patch for a fix, minor for a new pattern, file or source.

## Model routing
Opus plans, decides, writes self-contained briefs with a report word limit, and reviews every result. Haiku for search, reading and mechanical edits. Sonnet for coding, tests and multi-step work. Do 1-2 tool calls inline.

## Docs
README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, NOTICE.md; ideas and feedback in `IMPROVEMENTS.md`.
